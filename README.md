<h2>An automated scanning, note taking, and basic exploitation tool</h2>

<h1>Not complete yet</h1>

Meant to help easily go through Hack The Box machine and TryHackMe rooms and take good notes throughout the process.

This tool will run through a subdomain or single IP and scan it with nmap, search for exploits of the services it finds, and print out all the results in a markdown file so you can easily read through.

I am working on adding the automated exploitation of low hanging frui and perfecting the report format
