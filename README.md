An automated scanning, note taking, and basic exploitation tool

Meant to help easily go through Hack The Box machine and TryHackMe rooms and take good notes throughout the process.

This tool will run through a subdomain or single IP and scan it with nmap, search for exploits of the services it finds, and print out all the results in a markdown file so you can easily read through.

I am working on adding the automated exploitation of low hanging frui and perfecting the report format
