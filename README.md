<h2>An automated scanning, enumeration, and note taking tool</h2>

Meant to help easily go through Hack The Box machine and TryHackMe rooms and take good notes throughout the process.

This tool will run through a subdomain or single IP and scan it with nmap, search for exploits of the services it finds, and print out all the results in a markdown file so you can easily read through.

## Quick start
```bash
# From github
git clone https://github.com/gsmith257-cyber/EV1L-J3ST3R.git
cd EV1L-J3ST3R
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 EV1L_J3ST3R.py
```


I am working on adding more features and simplifying some of the code so create a pull request if you have any ideas.
