An automated scanning, note taking, and basic exploitation tool

This tool will run through a subdomain or single IP and scan it with nmap, search for exploits of the services it finds, and print out all the results in a markdown file so you can easily read through.

I am working on adding the automated exploitation of low hanging fruit.
